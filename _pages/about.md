I'm a interdisciplinary researcher who loves allying simple theories &
data-driven models to solve complex problems.

As an applied data scientist in the [Brain Networks](https://rajlab.ucsf.edu) Lab
[@ UCSF](https://radiology.ucsf.edu), I work on models that gives us insights
about and help improve diagnoses for a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases.

Prior to this position, I was an computational materials scientist at
[The GlotzerLab](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/) @ the University of Michigan
 and then an experimentalist at [The Douglas Lab](https://bionano.ucsf.edu/), @ UCSF.
