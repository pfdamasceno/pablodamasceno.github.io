I'm a interdisciplinary researcher who loves combining simple theories &
data-driven models to solve tough problems.

As an applied data scientist in the [Brain Networks](http://rajlab.ucsf.edu) Lab
@ UCSF I work towards understanding the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration
with the goal of improving prognostic and, ultimately, patient care.

Prior to working as a data scientist, I was an computational materials engineer at
[The GlotzerLab](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/) @ the University of Michigan
 and then an experimentalist, making nano devices out DNA, at [The Douglas Lab](https://bionano.ucsf.edu/) @ UCSF.
