I'm a interdisciplinary researcher who loves combining simple theories &
data-driven models to solve tough problems.

As an applied data scientist at the [Brain Networks](http://rajlab.ucsf.edu) Lab
@ UCSF I work towards understanding the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration,
with the ultimate goal of improving prognostics and patient care.

Prior to working as a data scientist, I was a computational materials engineer at
[The Glotzer Lab](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/) @ the U of Michigan,
and then an experimentalist, synthesizing nano devices out DNA at
 [The Douglas Lab](https://bionano.ucsf.edu/) @ UCSF.

I love meeting new people so feel free to drop me a message.
